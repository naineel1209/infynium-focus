# 🚀 Infynium Focus
*Your brain's new best friend. And your procrastination's worst enemy.*

A completely free and open-source browser extension suite designed to bolt two high-powered productivity engines onto your browser: InfyBlock and InfyDoro.

## Meet Your New Productivity Arsenal 🦾

### 🛡️ InfyBlock
*The no-nonsense digital bouncer for your browser.* Ever get lost in a YouTube rabbit hole when you should be closing a deal? InfyBlock puts a stop to that. It's less of a blocker and more of a focus guardian.
- **Block Everything**: Add an unlimited number of websites to your blocklist. The entire internet, if you must. We won't judge. 🌍🚫
- **You Call the Shots**: Set blocking periods for any duration. An hour, a day, a fortnight. Your focus, your rules. 🗓️
- **Master Your Workflow**: Create custom schedules that align perfectly with your work and life. ✍️

### 🍅 InfyDoro
*The Pomodoro Technique on steroids.* This isn't your average kitchen timer. InfyDoro is a precision-engineered system that slices your work into hyper-focused sprints and tactical breaks.
- **Laser Focus**: Automatically locks down distracting sites the second your focus session begins. 🎯
- **Strategic Breaks**: The moment the timer dings for a break, your websites are magically restored. Go on, watch that cat video. You've earned it. 😺
- **Track Your Wins**: Get hard data on your productivity streaks. See tangible proof of how much you're crushing it. 📊

## Why It's Awesome: The Stark Truth ✨
- **100% Free**: No trials, no "premium" nonsense, no credit card required. Ever. The price is $0. 💸
- **Fully Open Source**: Peek under the hood! The code is all yours to inspect, tweak, or build upon. We're an open book. 📖
- **Privacy First**: We track absolutely nothing. Zero. Zilch. Your data is yours alone. We're not creepy like that. 🕵️‍♂️
- **Feather-Light**: So lightweight, your browser won't even know it's there. No lag, just pure, unadulterated speed. 🕊️
- **Slick & Clean Interface**: A minimalist design with a satisfyingly smooth progress indicator, so you can focus on what matters—not our UI.
- **Infinitely Customizable**: Bend it to your will. Every setting is designed to fit *your* perfect workflow. 🎛️
